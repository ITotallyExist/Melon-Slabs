### Lightweight vanilla+ mod for fabric.

#### Current Features:
- Melon slabs
    - Can be crafted out of 3 melons in a crafting table
    - Can be crafted in a stone cutter with a melon.
    - Can be crafted back into a melon by placing two on top of each other.
    - Use the vanilla textures except for the bottom of top slabs or the top of bottom slabs, so they work well with texture packs

#### Planned Features:
- Rename pumpkins to Orange Melon
    - Orange melon slabs

#### F.A.Q.:
- ##### Will you port it to forge?
    - I have no plans to, but if you create a forge branch, I'll accept the pull request (assuming it works).
